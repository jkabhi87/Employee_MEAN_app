# Employee_MEAN_app
MEAN stack app for employee record management

To run the app in local host,
1. Download Node, Angular and MongoDB in your system.
2. Open another terminal and run 'mongod' -- this will start the mongo database server on default port of 27017.
3. Change directory to emp-app/backend and run "node server.js". This will start up the node app on port 3000
4. cd to emp-app and run "ng serve". This will start up the angular app on port 4200
5. Open http://localhost:4200 

If the node app fails to start due to missing dependency, please use "npm install" to install dependencies.
